Rocking out while playing your pinball tables is the best. The script snippets in this directory will help you play random or sequential mp3's / ogg's stored in your `VisualPinball/Music` subfolders, with magna button start/stop/next track abilities, as you play a specific table. What are your favorite musical pairings? Here are some of mine.

| Table | Playlist |

| AC-DC LUCI Vault (Stern 2018) | as provided with table
| Guns N Roses (Data East 1994) | as provided with table (with upgraded altsound) |
| Metallica - Premium Monsters (Stern 2013) | as provided with table (with upgraded altsound) |
| Centaur (Bally 1981) | [Tool - Fear Inoculum](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlzre6oa7gbHwqi5zWeRH9ZUd5D3Y5VTy&si=sMLDlJ7SPr9iixaz) This masterpiece table adaptation from UnclePaulie deserves a masterpiece post-apocalyptic soundtrack. |
| Elvis (Stern 2004) | as provided with table (with upgraded altsound) |
| Xenon (Bally 1980) | [RFTW Digital Display](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlzre6oa7gbHHmp9eF1oJwwtE1RfzdG6A&si=fWCvXbJm5EpKhyaA) is a perfect pairing, plus many more bangers from this 80's r&b group! |
| Gorgar (Williams 1979) | [Judas Priest Unleashed in the East Live in Japan '79](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlzre6oa7gbFMbjzazRLpdphnkxyyxrDw&si=zucdj2IFqDrdlOdO) made for each other. From the same year, even! Kick it off with **"The Sinner"** on game start, it really sets the tone for the ***god of the devils*** theme, then randomize this list and rock forever! |
| Warlok (Williams 1982) | Van Halen (randomize) this table has nothing to do with Van Halen but the Drakkor Jack Daniels clone table from a few years ago did (kinda) remind me of Eddie drinking it like gatorade and MH's guitar. This VPW version is such a fun table and should be in you top rotation so go with it! 
| Voltan Esapes Cosmic Doom (Bally 1979) | This table and its era just scream ELO to me |
| Rolling Stones (Bally 1980) | Rolling Stones vintage playlist to match the era

| Supersonic (Bally 1979) | Supertramp Breakfast in America (randomize) again, can't explain why but it just fits this era and backglass for me |
| Lucky Luke (Original 2020) | I added to the original playlist with famous cowboy singers, and I think it's now elite, right down to the sad "when a cowboy trades his spurs for wings" after every game over. |
| American Graffiti (Original 2024) | download the playlist from VPUniverse altsound section, it's amazing how they incorporated the jukebox feel into this one |
| Cosmic Gunfight (Williams 1982) | Steve Miller Band ("Space Cowboy" then random) IYKYK

| Stardust ( Williams 1971) | this ultra lounge tracklist is a really nice pairing for cocktail hour |
