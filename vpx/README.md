# Music and Pins ![](../images/handshake_32dp_E3E3E3_FILL0_wght400_GRAD0_opsz40.png "Optional title")
Rocking out while playing your pinball tables is the best. The script snippets in this directory will help you play random or sequential mp3's / ogg's stored in your `VisualPinball/Music` subfolders, with magna button start/stop/next track abilities, as you play a specific table. What are your favorite musical pairings? Here are some of mine.

| Table | Playlist |
| --- | --- |
| AC-DC LUCI Vault (Stern 2018) | as provided by the table
| Guns N Roses (Data East 1994) | as provided by the table (w/ upgraded altsound) |
